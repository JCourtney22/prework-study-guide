# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide has been created as a tool to suport me during my coding bootcamp. I created this project to kickstart and practice my skills, and develop my understanding and experience. I have learnt many things such as basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, as well as just how resourceful and resilient I am when I come across problems - of which there were a few along the way. I hope to add to this tool throughout my bootcamp.
